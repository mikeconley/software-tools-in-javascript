## Content

To suggest a tool that should be covered,
please put a one-paragraph description of the tool and the reason it's interesting
in a file called `tool-name.md`
(e.g., `style-checker.md`)
and add a link to that file to the list in [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md).
Where feasible,
include links in that file to examples of the kind of tool being suggested.

## Readers

1.  Geriel, 26, started working as a graphic designer five years ago and has slowly picked up some JavaScript programming skills.
    She wants to do more development,
    but feels that her lack of formal education has left large gaps in her knowledge.
    This book will teach her how the tools she uses work
    so that she can use them more effectively.

2.  Taban, 30, has been programming in Java and Python since finishing a BSc in Computer Science eight years ago.
    She has recently started using JavaScript for back-end development,
    and is spending an increasing amount of her time designing architectures rather than actually coding.
    This book will teach her how to think about how to structure medium-sized software systems,
    and show her some tools that her team should probably already be using.
