# Software Tools in JavaScript

*How to rebuild a web-based software ecosystem after the apocalypse.*

This repository holds content for a book about a tool-based approach to designing and building software.
All content is available under the open licenses described in [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md),
and our Code of Conduct is described in [CONDUCT.md](./CONDUCT.md).

## Content

1.  To suggest a tool that should be covered,
    please put a one-paragraph description of the tool and the reason it's interesting
    in a file called `tool-name.md`
    (e.g., `style-checker.md`)
    and add a link to that file to the list in [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md).
    Where feasible,
    include links in that file to examples of the kind of tool being suggested.

2.  Once work starts on a section,
    create a sub-directory with the same slug and move its description into that directory's `index.md`.
    (For example, when work starts on the style checker,
    its file becomes `style-checker/index.md`.)
    At the same time,
    add `_**` and `**_` around the tool's link in `INDEX.md` to highlight the entry.
    Keep all the source for the tool in its directory,
    including code, input files, tests, and so on.

## Readers

1.  Geriel, 26, started working as a graphic designer five years ago and has slowly picked up some JavaScript programming skills.
    She wants to do more development,
    but feels that her lack of formal education has left large gaps in her knowledge.
    This book will teach her how the tools she uses work
    so that she can use them more effectively.

2.  Taban, 30, has been programming in Java and Python since finishing a BSc in Computer Science eight years ago.
    She has recently started using JavaScript for back-end development,
    and is spending an increasing amount of her time designing architectures rather than actually coding.
    This book will teach her how to think about how to structure medium-sized software systems,
    and show her some tools that her team should probably already be using.

Common elements:
-   Understand:
    -   Data types: numbers, character strings, arrays, key/value stores
    -   Control flow: loops, conditionals, throw/catch, call stack
    -   Objects: constructors, member variables, inheritance, polymorphism
-   May have seen, but aren't sure how they work:
    -   Callbacks
    -   Closures
    -   Promises
    -   Observables
-   Are comfortable using:
    -   The Unix shell
    -   Git and GitHub
    -   Stack Overflow

Questions: how do I…
-   …make data available?
-   …build a browser interface to interact with that data?
-   …tell if that interface is working correctly?
-   …deploy it?
-   …manage its source code?
-   …test it?
-   …be more productive?

Concepts: I understand that…
-   …web pages are created by concatenating and interpolating text.
-   …security depends on authentication, authorization, and access control.
-   …source code can be manipulated just like any other kind of data.
-   …records of programs' activity are also just another kind of data.
-   …the best way to build software is to build tools that can easily be recombined.
-   …models and views should be kept separate.

Skills: I can…
-   …build a syndicated data service.
-   …display that data in web pages.
-   …make those web pages interactive.
-   …control who has access to what data.
-   …deploy my application.
-   …keep track of what my application is doing.
-   …manage the source code for my application.
-   …make sure that the application is working as it's supposed to.
-   …automate routine tasks so that the computer can do them for me.
