# Console Text Editor

Show how to create a simple console text editor (even smaller than [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/))
based on [terminal-kit](https://github.com/cronvel/terminal-kit)
and [this Python example](https://github.com/tdryer/editor/blob/master/editor/__main__.py),
and then add a record-and-playback facility.
This shows:

-   Event-driven programming.
-   Model-view separation.
-   Undo/redo.

This editor could then be a platform for other tools,
such as the world's smallest IDE or an interactive syntax checker like [Flycheck](http://www.flycheck.org/).
