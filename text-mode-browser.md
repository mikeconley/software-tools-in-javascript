# Text-Mode Browser

Re-create a small subset of [Lynx](http://lynx.browser.org/)
(similar in spirit to re-creating a simple text editor).

This shows:

-   How the HTTP request/response cycle works.
-   Model/view separation.

This can use, or lead into, construction of a simple layout engine,
and can be a platform for demonstrating two-factor authentication.
