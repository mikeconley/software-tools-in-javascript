# REST Data Service

Build a REST data service on top of [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to provide information about software projects.

This shows:

-   How to build services.
-   How to present data for machine consumption as a complement to presenting it for human consumption.

This service can then be used as the basis for
a [single-page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) interface
using the [front-end framework](./front-end-framework.md).
