# Profiler

1.  Show how to insert timing calls into function definitions.
2.  Show how to periodically sample the program for its current execution stack
3.  Show how to collect that data when running unit tests.

This shows:

-   That code can be manipulated as well as analyzed.
-   Builds on style checkers (parsing).
-   Motivates databases (recording performance data run-to-run).
-   The difference between a sampling and instrumented profiler
