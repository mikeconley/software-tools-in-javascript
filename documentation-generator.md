# Documentation Generator

1.  Write a documentation generator like [ESDoc](https://esdoc.org/) or [documentation.js](http://documentation.js.org/)
    that extracts embedded documentation, cross-references it, and creates web pages.
2.  Allow plugins for output and other special effects.

This shows:

-   That code is just another kind of data.
-   How to build tools that work with parsed code.
-   How to make a plugin-based tool.
